Note:

Wow I felt stupid at the conference since some the talks were very technical
and were made by actual data-scientists from Microsoft, Princeton, Transferwise and many
not-so-familiar company names who have an "AI" as part of their name. I'm still
trying to share some things which were interesting and what I somewhat
understood.

## Opening words

#### â€” Siim Sikkut, Estonian Government

----

* not much (read: *not at all*) AI is used in government sector yet
* communication with citizens could be improved
* not all things can be made online

Note: 

Communication: He brought an example where gov could communicate better with citizens
when child is born. Currently parents need to log into different systems to let
government know about their child's name, to book a place in some kindergarten
and so on. It could be done other way around - when doctor issues a ID code to
a new-born then government already knows about a new citizen and could approach
parents directly with some specific questions to get everything handled
semi-automatically.

Non-automated: Some things cannot be ever made online since they are too
important. For example when buying/selling real-estate people still need to
show their faces since it might be their most expensive asset during their
life-time. Same goes for getting married and divorcing - you need to show up so
that you would be aware of what you are really doing.

## Streamlining Team Work and Development Processes in Data Science Projects

#### Andrus Kuus, Proekspert

----

Note: Andrus is a "regular" software developer and he told about problems data
scientists are having right now. He proposed that data scients should look at
lessons learned by "regular" software developers from the last 20-30 years and
should not make the same mistakes again. For example, it's (supposedly) a big
problem that a VCS is not used among many things, toolset could be a lot better
etc.

## Measuring How Emotions are Driving Buying Behaviour Using Computer Vision and ML

#### Pierre Lupi-Chen, RealEyes

----

Note: There was this question from audience - does this technology also work
with Estonians. Presenter didn't quite get that joke, but admitted that human
face expressions differ between races (e.g. Asians have different
characteristics to monitor than Europeans).
